\title{Article V Constitutional Convention Proposal Draft}


\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Absctract}

	There is clear evidence that capaign fiance laws in the United State are no longer sufficient at preventing abuse of the electorial process.  This enviroment is in direct controdiction with the obligation that Pennsylvania's state legislators have towards ensuring that elections in the Pennsylvania are fair and free.   Since the cause of this current electorial enviroment is due to the supreme court's interpretation that campaign donations are protected under the first ammendment of the United State constitution, the only way the current electorial enviroment can be changed is with an ammendment to the consitution.  Ammendments to the United States constitution can be proposed in one of two ways,  the first is by ammendments proposed by the United States Congress and the second is by a constitutional convention called by two thirds of states in the union.   This proposal is meant show the legal justification and precidence of an Article V Constitutional Convention and that calling a convention, with the express purpose of reforming campaign finance laws in the United States, is the best way in which Pennsylvania state legistlators can fulfill their obligation toward ensure that elections are fair and free.  

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{History of Campaign }

\begin{itemize}

\item  The Federalist Papers are considered the framework in which the US constitution was based.   The intent of how the House of Representatives should function is stated as: "To have submitted it to the legislative discretion of the States, would have been improper for the same reason; and for the additional reason that it would have rendered too dependent on the State governments that branch of the federal government which ought to be dependent on the people alone." (James Madison, Federalist 52); and,
WHEREAS,

\item The idea of representatives should be dependent on the people alone has changed with supreme court desisions Buckley v. Valeo 1974 and Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission 2008 which have allow unlimited campaign controbutions be spent of political office. 

\subsection{Present Day}

\begin{itemize}

\item Elections are now primarily decided by campaign funds: "In 93 percent of House of Representatives races and 94 percent of Senate races that had been decided by mid-day Nov. 5, the candidate who spent the most money ended up winning, according to a post-election analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The findings are based on candidates' spending through Oct. 15, as reported to the Federal Election Commission." ~\cite{OpenSecretsWins}

\item The primary funders of campaign donations today make up a very small percent of the population: "Only a tiny fraction of Americans actually give campaign contributions to political candidates, parties or PACs. The ones who give contributions large enough to be itemized (over \$200) is even smaller. The impact of those donations, however, is huge."~\cite{OpenSecretsDemographics13}

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
 \caption{How much each donator bracket conrtibutes to campaigns. (* in millions of dollars) }
\end{table}

\end{itemize} 

\item Given the influence campaign funds have on deciding an election and the small percentage of the population that actually contributes to campaigns, the current electorial process of this country is unfairly skewed towards wealthy donors and provides a clear disadvantage to low income voters. 

Suppose that elections in PA are fair. Then  by the definition of a fair election, Elections in PA are free and equal. This means that by the definition of Free Elections in PA are not under the control or in the power of another; ;(Google definitions).   Also, this means that elections are equal.  However. statistically electorial wins are strongly corrilated with cadates that are better funded, "In 93 percent of House of Representatives races and 94 percent of Senate races that had been decided by mid-day Nov. 5, the candidate who spent the most money ended up winning, according to a post-election analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The findings are based on candidates' spending through Oct. 15, as reported to the Federal Election Commission." ~\cite{OpenSecretsWins}.  This strongly suggests ( I would have to prove more here probably), That the outcome of an election is determative on campaign controbutions.  Since there is inequality in campaign controbutions, then their is an inequality in how elections are determined. Since there is an inequality in how elections are determine then elections in PA are unequal.    (Only a tiny fraction of Americans actually give campaign contributions to political candidates, parties or PACs. The ones who give contributions large enough to be itemized (over $\$200$ dolars) is even smaller. The impact of those donations, however, is huge.) ~\cite{OpenSecretsDemographics13}  Since they are unequil then they are unfair. 


\end{itemize}
 
The proposal is meant to show the legal justification,  precidence, and nessesity of calling an Article V Constitutional Convention as described in the United States Consitution.  The purpose of this convention would be to propose ammendments to the United State constitution with the express purpose of reforming campaign finance laws in the United States. 

There is clear evidence that capaign fiance laws in the United State are no longer sufficient at preventing abuse of the electorial process.  This current electorial enviroment was caused by a series of supreme court descisions starting at the Supreme Court Case of Buckley v. Valeo in 1974 and ending most recently in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission 2008.  Since it is now the interpretation of the supreme court that campaign donations are protected under the first ammendment, there are not longer any restriction in the amount any one person can give to a

Article V of the US Constitution dictates that states, though their legislators, may at any time call for a convention to propose ammendments to the constitution if it is deemed nessisary.  The process requires that two thirds of all state in the union, submit resolutions to the United States Congress calling for a convention.  Once a convention is called, delegates from each state are sent to the convention to dicuss and submit ammendments to state for ratification.    An ammendment is pass in the event that it is ratifies by at least three forths of states in the union. 


\subsection{Problem}
I need to convince my state legislator to propose or support a resolution to call for an article V consitutional convention.

\subsection{What do I need to show for State Rep Staffers}

\begin{itemize}

 \item precident ( think they mean legal authority, and obligations)

\item studies of its effects

\item possible downfalls or pitfalls

\item support from public.

\item what has to be put into motion 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{What do I need to do after I address all the points from the staffers.}

\begin{itemize}

\item make a simple summary of argument

 \item send it to many other elected officials.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{What will be the general outline of the paper?}



\begin{enumerate}

\item  What is the goal of this paper?

I want to prove the statement: if my rep calls for an article V convention for campaign finance then it will significantly benifit american society.

\item what is a constitutional convention? It is a way to propose amendments to the constitution without needing congress. 

\item  Why should my rep call a convention?
 It will help fix our broken democrasy

\item Why is our democrasy broken?
our campaign finace system, lobbying, (anything else) produces inadiquite or detrimental legislation for most of the people in our society 

\item How will a constitutional convention fix it?

\section{What am I trying to prove?}
  I should give the legal justification followed by an historical example. 
\subsection{Main Statement I am trying to prove}

I want to prove the statement: if my rep calls for an article V convention for campaign finance reform, lobbying reform, and to end corperate personhood,  then it will significantly benifit american society? 

I want to prove the statement: if my rep calls for an article V convention for electorial reform,  then it will significantly benifit american society? 


Or.  

My rep is obligated to ensure elections of representatives of all level of government are fair in PA. 

Elections are not fair in PA.

Campaign finance refore would make elections fair in PA. 

Campaign finance refore is only possible now through a constitutional convention ammendment. 

my state rep can call for such a convention.... or something like that.. 

\section{How am I going to prove it?}

I need to continue to break up the statement: "if my rep calls for an article V convention for campaign finance reform, lobbying reform, and to end corperate personhood,  then it will significantly benifit american society? " Into smaller and simplier propositions until entire thing is proved.

(maybe instead of 'campaign finance reform, lobbying reform, and to end corperate personhood' more generally say 'fair elections' then define fair election). 

\section{Proof}

First I have to prove that the first proposition can be true.

Proposition 1: my state representative calls for an article V convention for campaign finance, lobbying reform, and to end corperate personhood.

Breaking up proposition 1:

if Anthony williams is my state rep then he can call for an article v consititional convention to propose ammendments to the constitution.

if a constitional convention is called to propose ammendments to the constitution then that convention can be held specifically for campaign finance reform.

if a constitional convention is called to propose ammendments to the constitution then that convention can be held specifically for lobbying reform.

if a constitional convention is called to propose ammendments to the constitution then that convention can be held specifically for ending corperate personhood.

\subsection{US consitution}

Axiom of  Legislator Oath (US con):  A state legislater must support the US consitution (see Appendix ~\ref{sec:ArticleVIUS}).

Axiom of State Legislators Regulating Elections: State legislatures can regulate national elections for their state (see Appendix ~\ref{sec:ArticleISection4US} ).

Axiom of Superseeding State Legislator Election Regulations:  Congress can override the regulations of state legislators.   (see Appendix ~\ref{sec:ArticleISection4US} ).

Axiom of Article V Constitutional Convetion:  State legislators can call for constitutional conventions to propose ammendments to the united states constitution when they think it is nessisary (see Appendix  ~\ref{sec:ArticleVUS})

\subsection{state house representative}

Definition of State house rep: If someone is a members of the state House of Representatives then they are members of PA General Assembly.

Axiom of PA legislative power:  If someone is a member of PA's general assembly then the have legislative power in PA.  (Note PA Legislative Power : The legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives. (see Appendix ~\ref{sec:ArticleIISection1PA})

Theorem of State house legistlative athority: If someone is a members of the state House of Representatives then they how the power to create legislation in PA: 

Proof of theorem:
If someone is a members of the state House of Representatives then they are members of PA General Assembly. by definition of Definition of State house rep.  Since the GA has the legislative power of the commonwealth by the Axiom of PA legislative power then a house rep can create legislation. 

Axiom of fair elections in PA: Elections in PA need to be fair. (see Appendix ~\ref{sec:ArticleISection5PA})

Axiom of State house oath: A state house representative is obligated to support, obey, and defend the  Constitution of the United States and PA (see Appendix ~\ref{sec:ArticleVISection3PA}).

Theorem of state house obligations toward fair elections:  A PA state house is obligated take actions that ensure fair elections. (note this theorem only says what their obligations are, it says nothing about that PA representatives athority. More about that later).

Proof of state house obligations (Not done yet):

We need to show to show that a state house representative is obligated to support fair elections on both the state and house level. 

So a house representative is obligated to support the Constitution of PA by the axiom of state house oath.  The constitution of pa requires that elections in PA be fair.  Therefore and house representative is obligated to ensure that elections are fair in PA on the state level.  Also, since PA state rep is obligated regulate elections on that national level by the Axiom of State Legislators Regulating Elections, then State house reps are obligated to sure that PA elections on the national level are fair . Therefore a state house rep is obigated to take actions that ensure that elections are fair on both the state and national level (note, the Axiom of Superseeding State Legislator Election Regulations seems to contradict this but it doesnt.  This theorem talks about what the motiviations of what the state legistlator should be, not what thier athority is.  This I will explain later. ). 


\subsection{Constitutional Convention}

Theorem of  PA state senators need to call constitutional convention for electorial reform. : PA state senators have the athority to call for a constitutional convention when it is to ensure fair elections.

Proof:  A PA state house is obligated take actions that ensure fair elections by the Theorem of state house obligations toward fair elections.  PA state house reps can also call for amendments to the constitution when they deam it nessisary by the Axiom of a Article V Constitutional Convetion.  Then PS state senantors have an obligation to call for a constitional convention when it is nessisart to ensure fair elections. 

Empircal Evididence of the validity of this theorem:   The PA legislator has in already passed resolutions for article V constititutional conventions for electorial reform.   (See Source Jpg on this).   Need to explain historical context behind this. 



Notes: What is left to do.  What type of reforms are nessisary?  

\subsection{Fair Elections}

Definition of a Fair Election (PA consitution):  A fair election is and election that is both free and equal.   (Note PA Constitution on Elections: Elections shall be free and equal; and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage.. (see Appendix ~\ref{sec:ArticleISection5PA})). 

Definition of Free: Adjective not under the control or in the power of another; able to act or be done as one wishes.

I need to prove the validity of this statement.  Elections in PA are not fair. Or Not(Elections in PA are fair).

Proof: 
%(Maybe proof by counter example would be more straight forward).. 
%

Suppose that elections in PA are fair. Then  by the definition of a fair election, Elections in PA are free and equal. This means that by the definition of Free Elections in PA are not under the control or in the power of another; ;(Google definitions).   Also, this means that elections are equal.  However. statistically electorial wins are strongly corrilated with cadates that are better funded, "In 93 percent of House of Representatives races and 94 percent of Senate races that had been decided by mid-day Nov. 5, the candidate who spent the most money ended up winning, according to a post-election analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The findings are based on candidates' spending through Oct. 15, as reported to the Federal Election Commission." ~\cite{OpenSecretsWins}.  This strongly suggests ( I would have to prove more here probably), That the outcome of an election is determative on campaign controbutions.  Since there is inequality in campaign controbutions, then their is an inequality in how elections are determined. Since there is an inequality in how elections are determine then elections in PA are unequal.    (Only a tiny fraction of Americans actually give campaign contributions to political candidates, parties or PACs. The ones who give contributions large enough to be itemized (over $\$200$ dolars) is even smaller. The impact of those donations, however, is huge.) ~\cite{OpenSecretsDemographics13}  Since they are unequil then they are unfair. 




We are given that that Elections in PA are not fair. 

I need to prove the validity of this statement: State sentators are obligated to take action. 

Since we are given that elections in PA are not fair.  Then  PA state house rep is obligated to take actions that ensure elections are fair by the Theorem of state house obligations toward fair elections.


\subsection{How to correction counter example:}

%Note what do i need to change inorder to change the counter example into an example of a fair election).

I need to show: that there exists a sequence of actions that can be taken to change the current unfair elections into fair ones in the future.  

I need to show: That this sequence of seps is optimal. 

Proof of there exists a sequence of actions : 
\begin{itemize}

\item PA state senators have the athority to call for a constitutional convention when it is to ensure fair elections by Axiom of Article V Constitutional Convetion.  Therefore, they can call for a constitutional convention. (This statement is true.  All other statement I have to make a strong argument that it probably will be true. )

	
\item  PA state senators would call for a convention though a bill stating their desire for a convention and how they want that convention to run.  ( * Then I would have to prove that this statement is very likely to be true.  Give Support here)

	for example!!!!! (Oklahoma http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lXcgUBnYMI  52:30   Larence Lessing).
	Runaway convention.

\item  When there is enough supports from states then a convention would be call be Axiom of Article V Constitutional Convetion.   * Then I would have to prove that this statement is very likely to be true.  Give Support here)

%Notes: danger of the convention (amature is better than the professional. ALso this is just to propose ammendments. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lXcgUBnYMI  56:26   Larence Lessing)

\item    Delagetes for the convention would be called through a random sample of the voting population. ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lXcgUBnYMI  56:26   Larence Lessing)
%Great NOTES!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lXcgUBnYMI 52:30).

\item  Delagetes deliberate on ammendments to the constitution within the that constaints of state resolutions.  

\item Delegates would make ammendments that call for the public financing of campaigns.

\item  States would ratify ammendments on fair elections because the random same of people woud reflect the opinion of the people concerning fair elections. (site public opinion).

\item  These ammendments would fix our unfair elections : (site previous studies here)

\end{itemize}
Therefore there exists these sequence of actions that would change our current unfair election system into a fair one. 

Examples of historical events that supports this. 



\subsection{This is the optimal way to fix the counter example.}

Argument: for parts 1-8.  Can be true even if the first statements are false ( give lessig's opinion of tactics). 

8:  Examples of other states implementing similar pulbic fiance systems. 

Examples of supporting opinions.

Supporting opinions should be in the front. 

Examples site opinion of lessig, political commenators, 

\subsection{fair elections mean a large public benifit to society.(Consiquences of this actions)}

I need to show that fair elections have a benifit to EVERYONE! By restablishing public trust in government. 


Note:  There is evidence of this based on PA previous call for a conventionand it ended up fixing the problem even though a convention was not heald. (Lessig)


%% Notes Tactics: This could be a section on evidence that this is an optimal solution.  Larence lessing 
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lXcgUBnYMI   51:45).



Empirical evidence shows that, this is not true:  

(* Intesting note.  the US consitution makes no reference to free and fair elections. Is this because of slavery???*). 

PA elections are 

I know there are studies on public financing of elections that suggests that more diverse canidates are elected. 

Representatives of congress are to be "dependent on the people alone." (James Madison, Federalist 52);
